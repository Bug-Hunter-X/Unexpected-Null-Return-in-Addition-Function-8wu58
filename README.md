This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving the handling of null values in functions. The initial implementation of the `foo` function immediately returns `null` if either input is null, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in applications that rely on the function's output.  The solution showcases a more robust approach using nullish coalescing or providing default values to handle null input gracefully.
